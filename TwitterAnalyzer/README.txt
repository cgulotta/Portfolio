Goal. In this project you will use Hadoop to build a tool for processing sets of Twitter posts (i.e.
tweets) and determining which people, tweets, and hashtags are most popular. The processing
of the data will be divided into two passes.

1. Count the number of times a user, tweet, or hashtag is mentioned/used across all
tweets. This is done in TweetPopularityMR.
2. Sort the results to form a ranking of most to least popular. This is done in TweetSortMR.
