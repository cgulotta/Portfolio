Goal. In this project, you will create an efficient solver for two-dimensional mazes. Each maze
consists a grid of positions. Someone moving through the maze can generally move in one of
the four compass directions (North, South, East, West) to advance to an adjacent position;
however, walls may block some of these possibilities. There is generally a start position, and an
exit from the maze. For a given maze, starting from the start position, your program should
either return a solution (i.e. a path to the exit) or determine that no solution exists. Your
program should also run faster than our single-threaded solvers. The implementations details
for how to solve the maze are left up to you, subject to certain restrictions given below, and
you may use any default Java library classes you need.
